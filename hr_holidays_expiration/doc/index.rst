This module let you manage the expiration of leaves.

Before using you have to assign expiration behavior on the leave type.

You can configure this on the Human Resources menu:

    **Configuration > Leave types**

The leave type is by default not expirable. Check this box in order to manage leave backlogs.
Please add the period in which the leave is valid.

When a manager want to be informed about a leave which is about to expire, tick the "Notify Expiration via Email" box.
Apply the period in days and the email templates.

A cron job called "Set expired holidays" will be executed every day.
This can be checked in the Setting menu: 

    **Automation > Scheduled actions**
